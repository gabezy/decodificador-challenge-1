This project was made during the "ONE - Oracle Next Education" program, a partnership between Alura and Oracle.

The challenge's goal is to construct a web application that can encrypt and decrypt a given text based on the encryption "keys", which are:

- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"<br>
- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"<br>
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"<br>
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"<br>
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"<br>
